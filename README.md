# Reworked-A3DMS-Missions
This version of a3dms missions has reinforcements for both bandit and static missions. You will need to run these missions and scripts for all of this to work because I had to work some code over in 2 mission monitor scripts for bandit missions to get the reinforcements to work and rework code in every bandit mission to get them to work off the new script versions.
